## Learnings

Last two month I've been learning React. This is the first time I use a different framework, so lot of learnings:

- Angular itself is a framework and give you a lot of tools out of the box to develop SPAs: forms, routing...
- How Angular works: not virual DOM, automatic detection for changes in some circunstances, components based in MVC architecture...
- Start an Angular project with CLI
- Create components. Different parts of each component.
- How to style: components and global styles.
- Built-in directives: ngFor, ngIf, ngSwitch.
- Attribute Directives: how to create them and why they are useful.
- Pipes: How to create them and its utility.
- Services: How to create a global state, get info from API and inyect this services to other services or components.
- Forms: Learned about two differents forms in Angular (template and reactives)
